# sorting-algorithms
A visualization tool for understanding many different sorting algorithms. Embeddable into html

# Technologies
This is a javascript program created utilizing the p5.js library.

# TO DO 
1. I want to convert many of the current structures over to objects in order to make the code much more readable and transferable
2. Fixing the stop and start functionality.
3. Implementing the step function for insertion sort and generalizing this model for others to implement (maybe find a way to step through the full sorting algorithm without a separate stepping function?)
4. Better documentation.
5. Timer
6. Progress of how sorted the elements are currently.
7. Change color theming.
8. Allow users to program their own sorting algorithms
9. Functionize the GUI
10. Place a random image in the bars as slices and then order them. (This is a drawing mode)
